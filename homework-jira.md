# PME Homework Activity - Black Friday Gifts

Sign up and create a free account on Jira.
Create a new project, select `Software development` project template. Select the `Scrum project` option. Next, choose the `team-managed` project type. Finally, enter the name `black-friday-gifts` for the project. Done!

## Project Stories

Your scrum master has spoken with the relevant stakeholders, and presents the following user stories to you:
- As a user, I want to be able to search for products by keyword.
- As a user, I want to be able to filter products by category.
- As a user, I want to manage my cart.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my cart and its total.

Add these user stories to your Jira project. Go to the `Backlog` view, and click on `+ Create issue`, change the issue type to `Story` (green bookmark).

## Project Epics

From these user stories, decide on **two** Epics that can contain these user stories. When you have decided on the two epics, add them to the `Timeline` view. Click on `+ Create epic` (purple lightning bolt), and give it a name.

Now assign the relevant stories to the epics Go back to the `Backlog` page, select the appropriate stories for the first epic by checking them, then on the right side, click on the `...`, then `Parent >`, then select the epic they should belong to. Repeat this for the stories that belong to the second epic.

Notice how the items in the `Timeline` view have updated.

## Project Tasks

Now it's time to break down the user stories into smaller tasks. 

In the `Backlog`, click on `+ Create issue`, change the issue type to `Task` (blue tick), and enter the description of the task. Repeat this for each task you decide on. If you are struggling to come up with tasks for a story - take inspiration from the `design` and `implementation` stages of the SDLC. For example, `Design product search page` and `Implement product search page`. Like before, you need to assign parent epics to these tasks.

## Project Sprints

We're almost done! Nothing can be displayed in the `Board` for now because we haven't created or started any sprints. So let's do that! Head back to the `Backlog` page, click on `...` on the top right side of the pre-created default sprint (Sprint 1), click on `Edit sprint` and give it an appropriate name.

Now we need to fill the sprint with the appropriate tasks. Perhaps, if you created `design` and `implementation` tasks, then it may be a good idea to also have `design` and `implementation` sprints.

To create a new sprint, look at the top right side of the `Backlog` issue list. There's a `Create sprint` button.

We are now ready to assign dates to our sprints so they reflect in the `Timeline`, and so we can start a sprint, and have the tasks appear in the `Board`. For each sprint, click on the `...`, then `Edit sprint`, next choose appropriate start and end dates for the sprint. Two weeks should be fine.

Check the `Timeline` view to see how the calendar has updated.

## Task Status

In the top right side of the `Backlog` view, there should be a blue button allowing you to start the first sprint. When you click it, it will direct you to the `Board` view. It should be filled with the tasks for the sprint that is beginning. Feel free to move the tasks to different columns on the board and see how your calendar updates.

## Bonus extras

- Assign tasks to members of the team (even if it's just yourself).
- Assign story points to tasks in the `Backlog`.
    - I use fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, ...) to account for margin of error for higher-complexity tasks.
    - A task that sounds easy to implement should be scored with a low number, e.g. 1, 2, 3.
    - A task that sounds difficult to implement should be scored with a high number, e.g. 20, 32.
    - A medium task should be scored with a number somewhere in between.
    - Now you can see the story points for each sprint.
